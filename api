   *  What is this?
   *  
   *    This JSON document should provide samples for trigger and action fields and,
   *    if required, a valid user access token corresponding to a test user on your
   *    service. We will use this data to automatically test your integration.
   *
   *    We have generated the scaffold for you, but feel free to update as necessary.
   *
   *  Where do I put this?
   *  
   *    This should be returned by your API at the following endpoint:
   *    {{test-setup-url}}
   *
   *  `accessToken` (OAuth only)
   *
   *    This should be a valid access token that corresponds to a user on your service.
   *
   *  `triggers`
   *
   *    For all triggers that have trigger fields, provide a set of valid values for
   *    those trigger fields. These will be used in requests to verify that trigger
   *    endpoints respond appropriately.
   *
   *  `triggerFieldValidations`
   *
   *    For all triggers with dynamic validators, provide a valid example and an invalid example.
   *
   *  `actions`
   *
   *    For all actions, provide a set of valid values for each action field.
   *
   *  `actionRecordSkipping`
   *
   *    If you have implemented record-skipping for your action, you can optionally
   *    provide test inputs that cause your action endpoint to return a record-skip response.
   *
   *    We highly recommend you implement record-skipping. Learn more:
   *    https://platform.ifttt.com/docs/api_reference#skipping-actions
